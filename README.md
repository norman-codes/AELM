# AELM
 AELM, or the Acoustic Emotion Labeling Model, is an attempt to train a neural network to recognize emotions from voice recordings to overcome the limitations of text-based sentiment analysis. This project began as a submission for DubHacks 2023, a hackathon hosted by the University of Washington.
